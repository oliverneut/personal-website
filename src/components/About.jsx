            I am Oliver Neut, currently 21 years old. Since I started studying Computer Science & Engineering, the field has always ceased to amaze and interest me. In the near future, I am planning to pursue a career in the tech industry. Besides the fact that I am a computer science student, I also admire other subjects such as finance, business, and entrepreneurship. Since I am part of an active investment club (Dalton Investment Group), I have learned to manage a portfolio while working as a group to make decisions and conduct meetings on a regular basis. The investing I have learned to love and I often find myself engaging with news regarding the stock market and the economy that we're all part of.
